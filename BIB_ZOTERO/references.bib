	abstract = {Existing research offers fearful conclusions on the use of online archival collections, finding that historians ignore and overlook the limitations of digital sources. However, an attitudinal case study at Newcastle University contradicts this consensus. This article discusses this study’s detailed findings, determining that historians and library professionals demonstrate abundant and nuanced awareness of issues relating to ‘digital selectivity’. Nevertheless, the interviewees suggested that this does not radically undermine their practice. The study also revealed compelling aspects of digital selectivity not currently observed in existing research, including the effects of career stage and the importance of cooperation with library professionals. While the existing literature provides appropriate and prudent concerns, it lacks tangible evidence pointing to a widespread phenomenon of poor digital historical practice. The article closes by recommending further research into historians’ digital information-seeking behaviour, but argues that standardized metadata practices must come first. Limitations, including the absence of rigorous quantitative data, must be resolved before a fuller appreciation for digital historical practice is developed.},

	abstract = {Computing and the use of digital sources and resources is an everyday and essential practice in current academic scholarship. The present article gives a concise overview of approaches and methods within digital historical scholarship, focusing on the question ‘How have the digital humanities evolved and what has that evolution brought to historical scholarship?’ We begin by discussing techniques in which data are generated and machine searchable, such as OCR/HTR, born-digital archives, computer vision, scholarly editions and linked data. In the second section, we provide examples of how data is made more accessible through quantitative text and network analysis. The third section considers the need for hermeneutics and data-awareness in digital historical scholarship. The technologies described in this article have had varying degrees of effect on historical scholarship, usually in indirect ways. With this article we aim to take stock of the digital approaches and methods used in historical scholarship in order to provide starting points for scholars seeking to understand the digital turn in the field and how and when to implement such approaches in their work.},

	abstract = {For centuries, understanding archives has been key to historians’ work. Within the last decades, the increasing availability of sources in digital archives has fostered a growing need to understand how the logics of these influence historical research. Because, even if the digital representations of the individual sources might appear similar to those in analogue archives, using digital archives impacts the work of historians in new ways. In this article, I offer an outline for a digital archival literacy which supports a professional reflection on the everyday uses of digital archives. I propose seeing the shift from analogue to digital archives as a shift in medium, which establishes a new set of logics for the archival production, content, distribution and use. The framework draws upon notions of media literacy developed within the British Cultural Studies tradition.},

Objetivo principal:
“In this article, I argue why historians, no matter if their subfield, needs to be able to question the economics, policies and systems design of digital archives. To that end, I offer a framework for supporting a professional reflection on the ‘everyday use’ of digital archives and the powerful forces that shape online content and availability.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 1)
Enconding/deconding model (Stuart Hall):
“a critical exploration of how the production, distribution and circulation of media (in this case, digital archives) influence signifying practices and interpretation (here, historical research).” (Jensen, 2021, p. 1)
A autora argumenta que a mudança de arquivos analógicos para digitais ‘é uma mudança de meio que estabelece um novo conjunto de lógicas para a produção, conteúdo, distribuição e uso dos arquivos’, portanto:
“Without knowledge about the economic, political and technical aspects of digital archives, users are in the dark when it comes to questioning how digital archives act as co-producers of historical research. Recent work by scholars in Information Science confirms the problem as they found that a majority of historians are using digital archives’ research tools (finding aids, search engines, catalogues, etc.),8 but seldom consider their impact on methodology.9” (Jensen, 2021, p. 2)
“The quality of historical research depends on an understanding of these logics because they have methodological consequences.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 2)
Understanding Archives
O foco da autora recai sobre “arquivos bem estabelecidos”, como arquivos nacionais, coleções especiais e instituições similares (2). Os financiamentos, as formas de acesso às fontes são bastante diferentes se comparadas às fontes analógicas. (3)
“The types of sources that are available online are very limited compared to what can be found on location. Still, their online presence makes them a thousand times easier to find. The perceived familiarity these digital collections’ project, which exists only on the surface, nevertheless lead users to believe that dealing with the analogue and the digital collections in these institutions is the same.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 3)
The Archive as Medium (p. 3)
“Archives are, when they become available online, part of a digital cyberinfrastructure. When archival institutions produce collections, they become part of a digital landscape with its particular logic of production and distribution. This shapes the archive as a cultural form, as a medium, and it means that the framework needs to prompt critical reflections on the institutional, technical and user-oriented aspects related to digital archives.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 3)
Modelo de Stuart Hall:
“conceptualises the entirety of mediated communication as creating meaning at all points in the cultural circuit. In short, it can help us to understand the totality of the new ways archives co-produce history when they become digital. In the Cultural Studies tradition being ‘media literate’ means understanding the many factors that influence media consumption.11 In the case of digital archives, this entails knowing how they affect what users find and perceive the digitised sources.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 3)
When Digitisation Becomes Popularisation
Primeiro passo para a “digital archive literacy”: “compreender como as diferenças na produção de arquivos analógicos e digitais afetam a disponibilidade das fontes” (3-4)
Arquivo analógico: todas as fontes estão disponíveis do mesmo modo (algumas estão inacessíveis, mas isso recebe a reflexão do pesquisador) Instrumentos de busca ajudam a ‘navegar’ entre as coleções e entender suas estruturas.
Arquivos Digitais: acesso e disponibilidade são distintas em função da seleção e re-categorização que acontece no processo de digitalização.
“Ou seja, mesmo que mantidas pela mesmas instituições, coleções digitais e analógicas representam duas lógicas diferentes para sua disponibilização.” (p. 4)
“The production of digital archives is, in many cases, about making more widely available what is (already) popular. This different logic of archival production means that historians always need to consider what they are (not) likely to find online, and what it means to their work.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 4)
Arquivos “tradicionais” estão se tornando mais focados no usuário, o que leva a um política de digitalização que privilegia coleções com demandas de acesso mais elevadas. Sobretudo diante do fato de dependerem de financiamento externo.
Ao mesmo tempo, empresas privadas  tem se tornado importantes “players”, e fazem parte dessa “cyberinfrastructure onde o conteúdo disponibilizado representa possibilidade de lucro” (4)
“Africanists, media and gender historians, and people working with decolonial Digital Humanities, have pointed out that digitisation may become a driver for re-traditionalising history because external funders only want to pay for what is already popular.17 If historians at large are not aware of this dynamic, they have no way of addressing the issue in question; how it biases research in their (sub)-fields or their individual research.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 5)
The Economy of Digital Archives
“Using digital archives for our research, we must, therefore, ask the same questions of digital as analogue archives: what can I expect to find and how does it affect my research as well as the historiography to which I am contributing?” (Jensen, 2021, p. 5)
“It is therefore essential to consider how being embedded in a wider cyberinfrastructure affects the design of the entire system of digital archives.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 6)
Questionning Systems Design
“Digital archival literacy requires understanding how the production of digital archives builds on technical designs that influence their usability.20 This means that (all) historians need to acquire digital competence on a professional level parallel to the skills that we have in understanding how classification and categorisation of sources affect our interaction with analogue archives and shape our research questions. If researchers use digital archives, they must understand (and teach) how different system designs impact finding and working with sources, because in the digital archive the only access to the sources is through its interface. One cannot avoid the technical infrastructure of the archive as it mediates all interaction with the items it contains.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 6)
Três aspectos gerais do design dos sistemas de arquivo digital que historiadores precisam tomar consciência para compreender como eles podem agir como co-produtores da pesquisa histórica:


Predefined subject categories


Searching via search fields and sorting of results


Understanding the importance of metadata
